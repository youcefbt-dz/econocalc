# EconoCalc ðŸ“Š

Hello,  
I'm Youcef Boutemedjet, a third-year Finance Management student at the University of Batna 1. I created this website to help students and those interested in economic and financial calculations.

## What is EconoCalc?

EconoCalc is a simple website that offers tools to calculate macroeconomic indicators, financial interest, and linear programming.  
Each page is dedicated to one specific tool, aiming to make things easier to understand and use.

## Current Tools:
- Inflation Rate Calculation
- National Income Indicators (VA, PIB, PNB, RN, RP, RND)
- Compound Interest
- Simple Interest
- Linear Programming (Simplex Method)

## Why did I create it?
Because I felt that students in our field needed something practical and easy instead of always searching through papers or confusing apps. I personally use these tools and wanted to share them with others.

## How to use it?
1. Open the website.
2. Choose the appropriate section.
3. Enter the data and youâ€™ll instantly get the result.

## How to run the project locally?
```bash
git clone https://github.com/youcefbt-dz/econocalc.git
cd econocalc
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload

```
